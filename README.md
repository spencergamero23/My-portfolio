# Overview



I decided to create a portfolio website as my project. My website is in React and has two pages. One home page and a contact me page.

To start a test server, after creating a clone of the repo, all you have to do is open the terminal cd into the "portfolio_frontend" folder then type "npm run dev". There should be a little pause and then a server will pop up with a link for you to access. The site should pop up and if you make any changes in the code you'll see a response almost immediately.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

### Home Page: My home page currently has an image of myself with a description all within a red circle. All white page with a header that has a home link and a contact me tab.

### Contact Me: This page is pretty simple. It's a form where the user inputs information and it gets sent to my personal email.

# Development Environment

To develop this software I used React, Node JS, and Vite.

- React: a JavaScript library that makes it easier to create interactive and dynamic web apps with reusable components.
- Node.js: a runtime environment that lets JavaScript run on the server, outside the browser.
- Vite.js: a tool that speeds up the process of starting and building projects with frameworks like react.

I used HTML, CSS, and some Javascript to build my project. I also used React and I also used this web3forms site to get some help creating my Contact Me page.
